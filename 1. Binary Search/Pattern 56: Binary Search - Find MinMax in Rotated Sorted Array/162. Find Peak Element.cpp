https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

/* Intuition:
1. arr[mid] is a peak if arr[mid] > arr[mid-1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]
2. If arr[mid] > arr[mid-1], there is no peak in left side so it should have peak in the right side
// **** keep moving towards increasing slope****
